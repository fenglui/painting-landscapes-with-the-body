## Welcome!
Inspired by Memo Akten‚Äôs work, [Learning to See](http://www.memo.tv/portfolio/learning-to-see/), we will create semantic segmentation images from our bodies and use them to synthesize photorealistic landscape images.

## Getting Started
Have you?
* Installed RunwayML Beta?
* Set up a [RunwayML Account](https://runwayml.com/)?
* Installed Adobe Photoshop?* 
* Installed [GIF Brewery](https://gfycat.com/gifbrewery)? (optional but fun!, Mac only)

*If you do not currently have Photoshop on your computer, you can create an Adobe account for a free 2-week trial.
