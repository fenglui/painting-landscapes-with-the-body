A workshop on semantic image segmentation and synthesis<br>
using RunwayML +  Adobe Photoshop

<br>
AI Lab @ NYU ITP<br>
Friday October 18 @ 6pm<br>
Conference Room<br>
<br>

## Welcome!
Inspired by Memo Aktenâ€™s work, [Learning to See](http://www.memo.tv/portfolio/learning-to-see/), we will create semantic segmentation images from our bodies and use them to synthesize photorealistic landscape images.
