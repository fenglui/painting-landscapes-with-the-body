1. In RunwayML, add SPADE-Landscapes to a Workspace
2. Input === File, then Open Directory === Image directory with 3. Adobe-processed images
3. Output === Export
    * Export Type === Image Directory (you can try the Video option, but it crashes on me)
    * File Name === select this to set the name and location for an image directory to store the exported images

4. Click Run Remotely
5. After the export process, check your new directory for the saved images!
