# Step 4: Video Creation using GIF Brewery 
Notes: Use this tool if the Video Export option in Step 3 fails and you end up exporting images instead. Also, there are many, many other tools available for this kind of task--this is just a suggestion!
1. Launch GIF Brewery
2. From the Start Screen or File menu, choose Stitch Images and Video 
3. Click the “+” button
    * Find your directory of exported images from SPADE-Landscapes 
    * Select all the images inside
    * Click Open
4. Click Stitch
5. Choose to Save OR Cancel to finetune and Set Image Delay
